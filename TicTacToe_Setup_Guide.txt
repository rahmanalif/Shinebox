TIC TAC TOE - UNITY SETUP GUIDE
===================================

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
1. TextMeshPro package installed (Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essential Resources)
2. X and O sprite images (PNG/JPG files)

UNITY SCENE SETUP:
------------------

1. CREATE THE GAME BOARD:
   - Create a Canvas (UI > Canvas)
   - Create an empty GameObject called "TicTacToeManager"
   - Attach the TicTacToeGame.cs script to it

2. CREATE 9 CELL BUTTONS:
   - Create 9 UI Buttons (Right-click Canvas > UI > Button)
   - Arrange them in a 3x3 grid
   - Name them: Cell_0, Cell_1, Cell_2, ... Cell_8 (top-left to bottom-right)
   - Each button should have an Image component (default)
   - IMPORTANT: Make sure each button has Image component, NOT Text component

3. CREATE STATUS TEXT:
   - Create UI > TextMeshPro - Text
   - Name it "StatusText"
   - Position it above or below the game board

4. CREATE RESET BUTTON (Optional):
   - Create UI > Button
   - Name it "ResetButton"
   - Add TextMeshPro text as child with text "Reset"

5. ASSIGN IN INSPECTOR:
   Select TicTacToeManager GameObject, then in the Inspector:

   UI REFERENCES:
   - Cells (Size: 9) - Drag all 9 cell buttons in order (0-8)
   - Status Text - Drag the StatusText object
   - Reset Button - Drag the ResetButton

   GAME SETTINGS:
   - Current Difficulty: Choose Easy/Medium/Hard
   - Player Symbol: Choose X or O (what the player will use)

   SYMBOL IMAGES:
   - X Sprite - Drag your X image here
   - O Sprite - Drag your O image here

6. PREPARE YOUR IMAGES:
   - Create or download X and O images (PNG with transparency recommended)
   - Import them into Unity (Project window)
   - Set Texture Type to "Sprite (2D and UI)"
   - Click Apply

DIFFICULTY LEVELS:
------------------
- EASY: AI makes random moves (very easy to beat)
- MEDIUM: AI plays smart 50% of time, random 50% of time
- HARD: AI uses Minimax algorithm (impossible to beat, can only draw or lose)

HOW TO CHANGE SETTINGS:
-----------------------
You can change these in the Inspector BEFORE running:
1. Current Difficulty - Choose how smart the AI is
2. Player Symbol - Choose if you want to play as X or O

The AI will automatically get the opposite symbol.

TIPS:
-----
- The player always goes first
- Click any empty cell to make your move
- The AI will respond after a short delay (0.5 seconds)
- Use the Reset button to start a new game

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If you get errors, make sure all 9 buttons are assigned to the Cells array
- Make sure X Sprite and O Sprite are assigned
- Make sure you're using Image components on buttons, not Text
- Check that TextMeshPro is installed
